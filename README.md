# **XRC20 +** [Beta]

So most dapps will have Owners and each owner may have shards in the dapp This standard will have the IP of the contract as an shard token, Each **shard** is equal to any other shard and will have a yield based on that proportion the the overall pool of capital generated by the contract

The XRC20 + standard is a token dividend standard for the XDC Network this standard is for smart contracts that require dividends to their token holders or for developers to sell stake in their contracts.

### **Example Execution:**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract DividendContract is Plus{
	constructor() public Plus(NAME,SYMBOL,TOTAL_SUPPLY){}
	
	function Payment() public payable{
		// Code for function
		Plus.Dividends();	
	}
}
```

To issue dividends you can call the Dividends() function and all tokens held in contract address  will will be issued to shard holders

### **Diagram:**

This contract standard is for contracts that will yield profits for the token holders based on contract performance
