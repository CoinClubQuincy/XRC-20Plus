# **XRC1170** [Beta]

So most dapps will have Owners and each owner may have shards in the dapp This standard will have the IP of the contract as an shard token, Each **shard** is equal to any other shard and will have a yield based on that proportion the the overall pool of capital generated by the contract

The XRC1170 standard is a token dividend standard for the XDC Network this standard is for smart contracts that require dividends to their token holders or for developers to sell stake in their contracts.

### **Example Execution:**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract DividendContract is XRC1170{
	constructor() public XRC1170(NAME,SHARDS,URI){}
	
	function Payment(uint _int) public payable{
		// Code for function
		Dividends();	
	}
}
```

### **Parameters:**

**Name:** Names the contract.

**Shards:** The total amount of circulating shards.

**URI:** holds some metadata about the resource of the token. 

To issue dividends you can call the Dividends() function and all tokens held in contract address  will will be issued to shard holders

### **Diagram:**

This contract standard is for contracts that will yield profits for the token holders based on contract performance
